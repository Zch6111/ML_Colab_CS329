        "**Submission.** Please insert your names and emails above, save your code in this notebook, and explain what you are doing along with your findings in text cells. You can think of it as a technical report with code. Before submission, please use `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` in the Jupyter menu to verify your code is runnable and save all outputs. Afterwards, you can either upload your raw notebook (`hw1.ipynb`) or an exported PDF version to the `Homework 1` assignment in Canvas.\n",

        "In this homework, we will train a house sales price predictor on the data we scraped previously. The purpose of this homework is to let you practice different techniques that you can use to preprocess raw data. Your job is to obtain the best root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) on the test dataset. To make your job easy, we provide sample code to train a model to report RMSLE and a list of ideas you can explore.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: You can use either local runtimes to complete this assignment, or a hosted runtime (with GPU) on Colab. The second option generally runs faster. If using a local runtime, make sure that your Python version is less than 3.9 but at least 3.6, or you may have issues installing Autogluon. If using a runtime hosted on Colab, you can use the File Explorer pane on the left to upload the `house_sales.ftr` file. Make sure to wait until the file finishes uploading before running the next code block.\n",
        "\n",

Note that we use the [`feather` format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html), which is faster to read than CSV but uses more disk space. The file `home_sales.ftr` can be downloaded from the Assignments folder in Canvas.\n",
